I have been wanting to write this for a while, and today I finally got to it.
In the previous post on this blog, which was written a little under a year ago,
I wrote about my ambitious plans to develop new features for MolView. I also
wanted to develop it from scratch, because in the meantime my programming style
had radically changed, and I had much better ideas about how to write software.
But since there also were (and still are) other projects I wanted to spend my
free time on, I promised myself I would only invest more time in MolView if it
turned out popular enough to collect a decent amount of donations. This would be
not only to make up for the invested time, but also cover service costs and
allow investment in additional services (such as web-servers to perform relevant
calculations).

I decided to setup an account on Bountysource where users could contribute a
monthly or one-time amount, and also vote for new features or issues that have
to be resolved: https://www.bountysource.com/teams/molview. I linked to this
page from the loading popup on molview.org. So far five people have donated a
total of 100$ (if you donated and are reading this, thank you very much, I
appreciate your support!). This is enough to keep MolView online for roughly two
years (which is great!), but unfortunately not enough for other endeavors.

I think it is time to face the fact that MolView is good enough as it is. Based
on recent estimates there are about .6 million users a year, which is something
that definitely makes me proud! But right now there is simply not enough
traction to support further development. I do not have time to push this more
(and for example write grant proposals), and despite the fact that some features
are repeatedly requested (such as Lewis-dot diagrams), I think the vast majority
of MolView users is already covered by the current feature set.

New features I personally found very interesting include a more sophisticated
integration of MolView into other websites (embedding molecules with visualized
bond angles for example), and providing MolView in other languages such as
Spanish, French and Chinese (potentially making it easier to use for millions of
younger students).

## The bottom line

I more or less officially announce that MolView will stay as it is right now,
and that at this time no plans exist to change it. I will keep doing my best to
answer support emails, and keep MolView online and accessible for free. I have
no plans to add advertising to MolView.org, in part because I am a strong
opponent of advertising in general (think about it, what would a world without
advertising actually look like?). If anything happens that changes any of this,
I will write about it on this blog.

## Patreon page

I also moved the main page for financial support to Patreon. I made this
decision primarily because Patreon is much more well known than Bountysource.
You can find the new page here: https://www.patreon.com/molview. If you believe
MolView is useful, and are in the position to donate a small monthly amount,
please consider doing so! (just 1$ would already be great).
